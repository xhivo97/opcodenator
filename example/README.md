# opcodenator Example
To build and run the example:

1. Build everything, which also runs the generator and writes the output to `decoder.h`:
```shell
make
```
2. Run the test:
```shell
./test_decoder
```
3.
Optionally, you can manually run the generator:
```shell
./generate_decoder > output_file.h
```
